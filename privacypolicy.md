Privacy Policy
##### Saeland privacy statement

By default, data is collected. This is indispensable, because in our scenario, the application ("bot user") requires the data to work correctly.  
This privacy statement will give you an explanation why we collect your data, and what we do with it, how we store it and how you can request deletion of your data.  
We, the developer team of the Saeland Discord application, are not affiliated with Discord in any way. Their policies apply to ours as well.

  

##### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

We are collecting your data legally using the information described in this policy, depending on the case and the context in which we collect the information:

-   We perform a contract with you
-   We have been given the permission from you
-   Processing your information in our legitimate interests
-   We need to comply with the law

We will retain your information as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy. We will retain and use your infomration to extent the necessary functionality, to comply with legal comply or legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies.  
If you are resident of the European Econimic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you request knowledge of personal data we hold about you, or want to request a removal of your data, you are eligible to contacting us:  Lukef#3842  
In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

-   The right to access your data
-   The right to request deletion of your data
-   The right to change your data
-   The right of restriction

You  **do not**  have the above mentioned rights if your data is used to restrict your access to our application or due to legal obligations or lawsuits and enforced protection of other users.

##### Data accessability

Data accessability is limited to the users, the developers and the hosting service of the application (replit).  
Developers do not view (or share) the data from users, unless

-   they are enforced by legal actions or the law
-   a user requests a deletion of their data
-   a user requests an update of their data
-   a user is restricted/approved to use the application

this does  **not**  count for IDs from individuals that are not users.

##### Discord

We collect unique values to idenfity a specific member or user, a message or channel and a guild or emoji (their "ID"). IDs  **do not grant access to account information**, they are used to  **identify**  a user. Having IDs saved won't hurt your account security in terms of accessibility.  
These IDs are used to

-   Run the integrated reward ("leveling") system
-   Save configurations, like a language
-   Restrict user or guild access
-   Obtain public viewable information, like creation dates or avatars
-   Send messages to specific users

You are eligible of requesting deletion of your ID, if you are not restricted to the access of our application. User IDs are saved permanently, due to the always running instance of the bots reward system, as well as the settings a user can configure, like the language. The reaosn behind that is, that users should have their saved settings when they use the bot again. The same rule applies for channel and guild IDs as well. Users can contact us to request deletion and get further instructions.

##### Logging

Starting January 1st 2022, we will start logging  **command usage**  as an addition to the logging of  **errors**  ("Interactions").  
The goal behind that, is to detect abusage and to find errors. We will log the following data:

-   The command without the filled parameters
-   The error and its type (if an error occurs)
-   The user who invoked the command
-   The channel where the command was invoked
-   The channels guild
-   The ID of all mentioned items

The interactions are logged in channels where only the maintain developer and the application have access to. They are not deleted, however they might be if the amount of messages in the channel is getting too high.  **We want to clearify, that we do not log messages and message content at all, save it, share it, or store it in any other way.**

##### How data is stored

Bot uses database: Mongodb. Only the owners have access to these files and the data. If we notice a data breach, we will immediately notify our users.
